# puretasks

## What puretasks does

A task workspace for organizing project work, tracking status, and reviewing queues. Save boards, update task details, and connect tasks to relevant resources in the suite.

## App layout

| Area | What you use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **Navigation rail** | Choose a board or work queue and return to available boards. |
| **Task workspace** | Review the tasks in the selected board or queue. |
| **Task details** | Inspect and edit a task’s fields, owner, status, and linked context. |
| **Status and review controls** | Move work through its stages and review what needs attention. |

The app also uses the shared [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) shell and drawer agent. Panels can vary with the current view and selection.

## Getting started

1. Create a task board and add the work you want to track.
2. Update task details and status as work progresses, and link relevant resources.
3. Review queues regularly and save the editable board as a `.tasks` document.

Read the [app guide](docs/app-guide.md) for development, loading, and source-layout details.

## Develop and customize

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. You can add features to puretasks, develop a fork, or create a new app for [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai).

### Use Claude Code, Codex, or your own tools

Open a local source checkout or a purefactory project's folder in your preferred coding tool. Ask it to read this README, `plugin.json`, `package.json`, `agents.md`, and the [development guide](docs/development.md) before making changes. Review the changes, run the app's checks, and test it inside [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai). This source may require matching shared platform packages; a browser preview alone does not provide desktop services.

The [development guide](docs/development.md) explains how to start Claude Code or Codex in the project, work on this repository, and load your app into the desktop.

### Use purefactory inside the desktop

Open **purefactory** (Factory) to describe a new app, or select an available app project and request a feature. Use **Open folder** to continue with external tools and **Open app** to test the result. You can also request a local app change through the app's drawer where app-development integration is available; distinguish changing the app from editing its current document.

Use **Share** in purefactory to create a `.pureapp` package. In current builds, install it through **Settings → System → Install an app → Choose package…**. See the [development guide](docs/development.md#load-and-share-your-app) for the full workflow and version differences.

## Developer accounts and the marketplace

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. Go to [puredesktop.ai](https://puredesktop.ai) and [create a developer account](https://puredesktop.ai/developers) to join the developer community and submit your app for review.

Bring improvements to this app, develop a fork, or build something entirely new. We welcome **open-source and proprietary projects alike** to the [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) marketplace. Support for **paid apps is coming soon**, so you will be able to charge for your apps if you choose. Forks and redistributed dependencies must follow their applicable licenses.

For developer access, app submissions, or marketplace questions, contact [info@puredesktop.ai](mailto:info@puredesktop.ai).
